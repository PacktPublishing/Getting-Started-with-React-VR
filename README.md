# Getting Started with React VR
This is the code repository for [Getting Started with React VR](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/getting-started-react-vr?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788476607), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Virtual Reality, from a computer standpoint, has been around since the 1960s. It started up again in a big way in the late 90's, and then mostly collapsed for a whileâ€”although it's never really gone away. It is back now, and, this time, it is here to stay.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
<Box
 dimWidth={4}
 dimDepth={1}
 dimHeight={9}
 lit
/>
```

You will need a Windows PC, of nearly any type; for maximum enjoyment, you will need  VR rig. Either an HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, a Samsung Gear VR, Google Daydream, or other VR goggles (including the Google Cardboard) and a cell phone.

You can develop these WebVR worlds even if you don't have a sophisticated Head Mounted Display (HMD) or VR Headset ; you can view them in flat mode on your regular computer screen.  You can pick up a simple VR cell phone holder/headset (Google Cardboard or similar) for less than 20 dollars or even free in many places, so don't let hardware be a barrier to learning about the next great thing.
